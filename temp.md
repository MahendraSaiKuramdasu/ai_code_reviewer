❌ Bad Code:
```javascript
function(){return a+b}
```

🔍 Issues:
* ❌ Missing function name. Anonymous functions are valid but should typically be assigned to a variable or used as a
callback.
* ❌ Variables `a` and `b` are not defined within the function's scope. This will likely lead to errors or unexpected
behavior.

✅ Recommended Fix:

```javascript
function add(a, b) {
return a + b;
}
```

💡 Improvements:

* ✔ Added a descriptive function name (`add`). This makes the function reusable and easier to understand.
* ✔ Defined parameters `a` and `b` as inputs to the function. This makes the function predictable and prevents it from
relying on potentially undefined global variables.

Alternatively, if you intend to use this as an anonymous function:

```javascript
const add = function(a, b) { return a + b; };
```

💡 Improvements:

* ✔ Assigned the anonymous function to the constant `add`, achieving the desired functionality.
* ✔ Maintained clear inputs `a` and `b` for predictable behavior.

Final Notes:

The original code snippet had two critical flaws: a missing function name (if it was intended to be a named function)
and undefined variables. The corrected version addresses these issues by providing a named function that clearly defines
its inputs and returns their sum. The alternative solution uses an anonymous function assigned to a variable. Always
consider scope and function naming for clarity and maintainability.
